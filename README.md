Unity-for-Arch
==============
This project is a port of the Ubuntu Unity desktop and most of its features to Arch Linux. Please see the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/unity) for more information.

Installation from binary repositories
-------------------------------------
Per Chenxiaolong (see his comment here: https://github.com/chenxiaolong/Unity-for-Arch/issues/232), the binary repos are no longer being maintained. Building from source is the only available option at this time.

Compiling from source
---------------------
Please make sure you don't already have modified versions of the dependencies installed. For example, gtk3-ubuntu might fail to compile if there's a modified version of gtk3 already installed.

Packages ending with "-ubuntu" contain Ubuntu patches and *REPLACE* Arch Linux versions of those packages.

To compile from source, just build all of the packages in the following order:

| Package                          | Description                                |

Troubleshooting
---------------
See the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/unity) for more troubleshooting tips.

* AHH! Something is wrong with Unity!

    Try resetting the settings for Unity and Compiz and relogin:

        compiz.reset
        rm -rvf ~/.cache/unity/
        rm -vf ~/.cache/unity-lens-video

    If something is still wrong, please file a bug report at either:
    
    [Github](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/Unity-for-Arch/issues)

    or

    [Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity-for-arch)

* The global menu does not show up for Qt 4 applications.

    Just install `appmenu-qt`
